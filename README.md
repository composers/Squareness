What is Squareness?

Think in squares. Let them take your imagination to a whole new level! Squareness lets you divide an image into squares and apply different effect to each. Create unique and cool art with just a few taps. Are you into chaotic patterns, or maybe something neat and predictable? It's your choice. Just tap on a square and choose an effect. If you are feeling lazy, you can always let the app apply effects randomly and surprise you. Additionally, try changing the square size, the available effects or apply a grid. If you change your mind, you can always undo the applied effects for a particular square or the whole image.
